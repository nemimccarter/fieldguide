Milestones
----------
1 - Build a softmax image classifier that
    successfully identifies photos from
    Oxford 17 and Iris datasets
2 - Successfully train classifier on some
    local plants
3 - Build a convolutional neural network that
    successfully identifies photos from Oxford
    17 and Iris datasets
4 - Program can accurately identify
    photos of leaves of a few local species,
    maybe only photos of particular
    structures, eg leaves, stems, flowers
5 - Program can accurately identify a few
    local species, regardless of how photo
    was taken
